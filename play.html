        <h4>ACT IV.   Sitting-room in Mrs. Arbuthnot’s House at Wrockley.</h4>
        <p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
            night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
            was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
            on one’s nerves.</p>
            
        <p>MRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p>
        <p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
            afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
            Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p>   
        <p>MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks
            quite the happy English home.</p>   
        <p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
            One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
            Gerald.</p>  
        <p>MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
            a good influence is the worst in the world.</p>   
        <p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
            will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.</p>   
        <p>MRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
            home.</p>
        <p> LADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women
            in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
            orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a
            sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
            that one can look at without blushing.</p>

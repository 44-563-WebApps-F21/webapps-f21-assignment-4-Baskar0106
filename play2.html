        <p class="speech">Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
            if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
            me I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very
            particular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
            who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
            was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.</p>
        <h6 class="MRS. ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>  
        <p class="speech">I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the
            devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>
